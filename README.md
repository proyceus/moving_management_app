Created a dummy app to help move managers easily keep track of items/where they are being stored.

A user first needs to login using Auth0.

Once logged in the user is presented with a dashboard showing all of the information. They can see total the total items they have added across all moves, the total number of boxes across all moves, a list of recent items added and the current list of active moves they have. The dashboard is also where the user can add new moves.

In the Add Items tab, the user can add individual items to each active move. The user can select which box to input the item. If a box doesn't exist then it will be created in the database. The recently added list will populate with items that were added and the respective date it was added.

On the My Inventory page, the user can see all of the items that they have added and which move/box they are in. You can filter these by move or see all items.
